                    At ChaseTail.com pet recovery service we have the technology to contact the majority of the nearest
                    cell
                    phones registered in your area. Fill out your lost pet’s description, information and
                    upload a picture. You choose the size of the search that fits your needs and Chase Tail
                    will actively contact most cell phones registered in the area immediately surrounding
                    where your pet disappeared. The majority of found pets that don’t return on their own
                    are found the first day after we start the search.
