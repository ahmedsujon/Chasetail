            <h5>First, upload a picture of your pet to begin your search on Find Fido Fast Lost. We use facial
                recognition
                technology to help match lost pets nationwide. Next, call your local animal shelter or animal control
                agency. Give them your contact information, with a backup contact to ensure that you can respond to any
                sightings promptly. Also conduct a search of your nearby area. Most pets are found within a few blocks
                of where they went missing.</h5><br><br>
            <h5>Can I report a lost dog?
                Yes. With Find Fido Fast Lost, you can post a picture of the lost dog on our database. Share the pet
                listing
                you created to a social network like Nextdoor or Facebook. Call your local animal shelter, non-emergency
                police number or animal control office. Alerting these channels can let them know to be on the lookout
                for a lost pet.</h5><br><br>
