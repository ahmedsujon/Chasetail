                No. FindFidoFast will never distribute your phone number publicly. Anyone seeing or finding your pet
                will eith be routed to our operator to contact you or they can contact you directly through our system
                with your phone number hidden from their view.

            <h5>
                <strong>How do I know which size package to choose for distribution?</strong>
                Since you choose a package based on number of people to contact, population density in your area is
                important. If you live in an apartment complex, for example, you may have over 500 people in that
                immediate vicinity. A dog can travel past that boundary quickly. In that case we suggest choosing a
                larger distribution package.
