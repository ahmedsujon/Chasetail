                    No. ChaseTail.com pet recovery service will never distribute your phone number publicly. Anyone
                    seeing
                    or finding
                    your pet will either be routed to our operator to contact you or they can contact you directly
                    through our system with your phone number hidden from their view.

                        distribution?</strong><br>
                    Since you choose a package based on the number of people to contact, population density in
                    your area is important. If you live in an apartment complex, for example, you may have over
                    500 people in that immediate vicinity. A dog can travel past that boundary quickly. In that case
                    we suggest choosing a larger distribution package.

                <h5>
                    If you live in a more sprawling area, a smaller package could cover more terrain. You may get
                    enough coverage choosing a distribution package with a smaller number of people. For
                    example, if the houses in your area are an acre or more apart, 500 people covers a much larger
                    area!
